## 1. Purpose and Philosophy

The LANA License is a memorial-focused license designed to ensure that data models, methodologies, and projects addressing childhood homelessness remain a pure tribute to those lost.

The core intent is to prevent the overshadowing of the cause by individuals, corporations, or institutional titles. This license prioritizes the memory of the victims over the professional or social capital of the creators and implementers.
